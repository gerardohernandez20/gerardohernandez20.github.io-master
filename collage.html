<p>I have always been a huge astronomy fanatic to a point where I watch many space documentaries and read various books about space theory. It is just what was able to grab my attention as a child. Here I present you my space project in which I have created in Clip studio and edited in Lightroom. No one truly knows how the galaxy looked when the big bang occurred (the current theory we have as to how the universe started)but I like to think that it happened with various colors. I have been drawing galaxies for a while now and it is the main reason why I like digital art.</p>
