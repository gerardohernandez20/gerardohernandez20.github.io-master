<h2><font color="black"> I have created a art peice which inlcudes both a static and an interaction peice. For my interaction peice I have tried to make square come out randomly in different places. the color of the squares are a light green. As for the interaction part the coursor will automatically draw blue circles when if you left click and hold the circles will be able to change the color to red. The static image consist of dots and a black image. Then i Have a circle, halfmoon cirlce, and a triangle. the shapes arecolored red and my intention for my static peice is that i wanted to make it look like some kind of logo that most youtubers would have.</h2></font>
