<em><font color="white"><h2>I made this interaction piece when I was in my digital media art class.  Not specifically a game, just a place where one can interact with my code. This was more solely for experimentation and it is possibly my first piece of code in which one can interact with. For my interaction piece I made small light green squares come out randomly in different places. One will interact with the courser which will automatically spawn purple circles while hovering around the interaction box. If you left click and hold, the circles will change to red. </h2></font></em>
